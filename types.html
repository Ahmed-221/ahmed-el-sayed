Operating systems distribute processor time between these programs so that each program takes a specific time from the processor and then pauses the program and gives another program this time. This means that during one moment, one program running on the processor and operating system is changing very quickly as parts of a second. The process of allocating processor time is called scheduling, where the operating system maintains a list of programs that the user has run, and the scheduling process distributes time for each program in this list to benefit from the processor at this time</td>

                <p>Operating systems are used on most, but not all, computers.</p>
                <p> The simpler computers with smaller implanted systems and many early computers without an operating system, instead of operating systems,
                    have relied on application programs to manage hardware with their knowledge, perhaps with the help of libraries designed for this purpose.
